# Projects
---
This repository contains notebooks that I created while studying at the university, in the online school karpov.courses and in the process of self-studying the basic tools needed for data analysis.

## classification_site_users.ipynb 

Ð¡ontains an analysis of user behavior on the Internet in order to recognize the target user from his Internet sessions

## eda_cluster_analysis.ipynb 

Contains an exploratory analysis of a dataset containing information about housing, as well as cluster analysis of housing based on characteristics such as sale price, location type, area, etc.

## eda.ipynb 

Contains an exploratory analysis of a dataset containing information about client's credit history

## ab_test.ipynb 

Contains A/B-testing of the hypothesis, which consists in launching a new mechanics of payment for services on the site

## sql_queries 

Contains some sql queries written by me as part of the training at the online school karpov.courses

## optimization_algorithms 

Contains optimization algorithms that allow finding those points in the function definition area at which it reaches the minimum or maximum value

## multiobjective_optimization 

Contains an algorithm that allows to construct a Pareto-optimal set of alternatives, minimizing or maximizing the given criteria

## graph_optimization 

Contains algorithm Dijkstra that allow to find the shortest path from one of the vertices of the graph to all others, and algorithms Prima and Kruskal that allow to construct the minimum spanning tree of a weighted connected undirected graph

## travelling_salesman_problem 

Contains the implementation of Ant colony algorithm that allow to to search for the most profitable route passing through the cities
