# Projects
1. optimization_algorithms contains optimization algorithms that allow finding those points in the function definition area at which it reaches the minimum or maximum value
2. multiobjective_optimization contains an algorithm that allows to construct a Pareto-optimal set of alternatives, minimizing or maximizing the given criteria
3. graph_optimization contains algorithm Dijkstra that allow to find the shortest path from one of the vertices of the graph to all others, and algorithms Prima and Kruskal that allow to construct the minimum spanning tree of a weighted connected undirected graph
4. travelling_salesman_problem contains Ant algorithm that allow to to search for the most profitable route passing through the cities
5. sql_queries contains some sql queries written by me as part of the training at the online school karpov.courses
