Task:
Educational courses consist of various lessons, each of which consists of several small tasks. Each such small task is called a "pea".

Let's call a very diligent student a user who correctly solved 20 peas in an hour at least once during the current month.
It is necessary to write an optimal query that will give information about the number of very diligent students in March 2020.


  SELECT         COUNT(DISTINCT st_id) as numb_diligent_students     FROM         (SELECT            st_id,             timest,             ANY(timest) over (PARTITION BY st_id                             ORDER BY timest ASC                            ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING and 19 PRECEDING) as prev         FROM            peas         WHERE             Year(timest) = 2020         AND             Month(timest) = 3         AND             correct = 1         ORDER BY            st_id ASC, timest ASC) as q1     WHERE         dateDiff('second', prev, timest) <= 3600
